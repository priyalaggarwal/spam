Sorry to post it here, but want to make a note, lest I forget.
You two could post notes too.

Things to do:
  1. Understand plot and rerun
  2. Look into varied results of algorithms
  3. Find more ways of comparing the results
  4. min_df and max_df usage into countvectoriser
  5. ROC and AUC
      Code: (IMPORTANT: first argument is true values, second argument is predicted probabilities
              print metrics.roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred_prob))
